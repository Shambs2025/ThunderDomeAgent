    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Neutral -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tabbed dashboard interface ("Strategy", "Round Guide", "Player Watchlist") was chosen to break down the dense draft guide into manageable, task-oriented sections. This avoids overwhelming the user with a long scroll and allows them to focus on their current need (e.g., overall strategy vs. specific round picks). The interactive watchlist provides a quick, filterable reference to all potential targets, which is a significant usability improvement over scanning a text document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Mid-draft focus -> Goal: Inform/Compare -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Static visual -> Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the recommended positional allocation, making the strategy easier to grasp at a glance. Library: Chart.js. Report Info: Player lists per round -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Presentation: Interactive Cards in an Accordion -> Interaction: Click to highlight -> Justification: Cards are more visually appealing and scannable than text lists. Highlighting provides simple feedback for user's own tracking. Method: HTML/CSS/JS. -->

                        At the 9th overall pick, the top-tier quarterbacks are likely gone. Instead of forcing a pick, the optimal strategy is to grab the best available player, regardless of position. This allows you to secure an elite difference-maker while other teams are scrambling for their second quarterback. Focus on building a strong core early and then target quarterbacks at the turn.

                                <li><strong>Don't Panic on QBs:</strong> The value in rounds 2-3 for QBs is excellent. Secure an elite skill player first.</li>
                                <li><strong>Work the Turn:</strong> Your picks at 2.20 and 3.33 are crucial. Plan to grab your QB1 and another top asset here.</li>
                                <li><strong>Build WR Depth:</strong> The mid-rounds are rich with wide receiver talent. Capitalize on this while others reach for RBs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Late-Round Upside:</strong> Focus on rookie QBs and high-potential handcuffs in the later rounds.</li>
